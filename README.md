# OST-Morse-Box-DG
Extension of the original OST Morse Box with a Decoder and an AF Generator, but remaining fully compatible with the existing hardware.

The OST Morse Box can be extended in software and hardware, to include a CW decoder for transmitted AND received signals. 
For receive a small extra PCB must be assembled, and connected to input D2 (connect at the Paddle Test jumper).

For alignment purposes, the OST Morse Box now also contains an AF Generator, which can also provide in a genral use test signal.

The Windows program has been amended with the necessary extra functions, and a new and easy way to program the firmware into the Arduino Nano is provided with the program XLOADER.

We hope you find these extensions useful and fun!
